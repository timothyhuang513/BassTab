    question: "What does BassTab do?",
    answer:
      "BassTab is an AI-powered tool that isolates the bassline from a song and generates bass tablature (tabs) from it.",
  },
  {
    question: "What audio formats can I upload?",
    answer:
      "Currently, BassTab supports MP3 files. Support for more formats like WAV and FLAC may be added in the future.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to know music theory to use BassTab?",
    answer:
      "Not at all! BassTab is designed to be beginner-friendly. Just upload a song and weâ€™ll handle the bass isolation and tab generation for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I download the tabs?",
    answer:
      "Not yet, but downloadable tab files are coming soon. For now, you can view generated tabs directly in the app.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my uploaded audio stored?",
    answer:
      "No. BassTab processes your file temporarily to generate the bassline and tabs. Once the result is returned, the file is discarded.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work with any song?",
    answer:
      "BassTab works best with clear recordings where the bass is not heavily distorted or buried in the mix. Results may vary depending on the quality of the input.",
